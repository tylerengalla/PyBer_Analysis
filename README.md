# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
Using Python and Pandas, we needed to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type from two seperate csv files that contain metadata on thounsands of rides. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
